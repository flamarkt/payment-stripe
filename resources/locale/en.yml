            alwaysRedirect: Always finish order with redirect
            alwaysRedirectHelp: >
                With embedded checkout, always redirect instead of using in-page Stripe confirmation.
                This most likely offers no benefit and only increases the time it takes to complete the transaction.
            cardOnly: Card only
            cardOnlyHelp: >
                With embedded checkout, uses minimal card interface and offer 3D-secure in an iframe instead of leaving the website.
                This feature is partially implemented, because even when using the mode where payment method can be chosen, card is still the only option offered.
            captureLater: Capture later
            captureLaterHelp: >
                Sets <code>capture_method</code> to <code>manual</code>.
                Order will be considered paid on a successful hold.
                The order editor will include a button to manually capture the funds later.
                There is currently no feedback if you let the hold expire.
            forceLocaleAuto: Force auto locale
            forceLocaleAutoHelp: >
                By default the current forum language will be set as Stripe <code>locale</code>.
                Use this option to always use <code>auto</code> instead.
                This might be required if your forum locale is not supported by Stripe.
                Currently only affects Stripe's hosted checkout.
            applePayDomainAssociation: Enable Apple Developer
            applePayDomainAssociationHelp: >
                When enabled, the extension takes care of setting up the <code>.well-known</code> file for Apple Pay Stripe Association.
                See <a>Stripe documentation</a> for the next steps in Stripe dashboard.
                Only necessary for embedded checkout.
